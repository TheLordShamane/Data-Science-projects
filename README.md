Data Science Projects

This repository contains a collection of data analytics and data modeling projects developed using real-world datasets.
Each project demonstrates practical applications of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical modeling, and machine learning.

Overview

The projects in this repository focus on:

Data Analytics: Cleaning, exploring, and visualizing datasets to extract actionable insights.

Predictive Modeling: Implementing regression, classification, and clustering algorithms.

Feature Engineering: Transforming raw data into meaningful representations for better model performance.

Evaluation & Optimization: Comparing models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and RMSE.

Visualization: Presenting findings through clear and interpretable plots and dashboards.
